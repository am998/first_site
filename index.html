					I am currently working towards my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of St. Andrews. On these pages you can find our more about me, my research and my other interests. Please feel free to contact me via email about my work (am998 at st-andrews.ac.uk).
				</p>
				<p>
					My PhD focuses on how technology is used in a school environment and how this may impact on the future of more traditional learning processes - like handwriting. I have been lucky enough to have the opportunity to pursue this research in lots of interesting ways and meeting lots of interesting people. You can read more about my research <a href="features.html">here<a/>. With luck I expect to finish my thesis in 2016.

					As well as completing my PhD I am raising my 4 children and working in various capacities. You can find out more about what I have been doing <a href="about.html"> here</a>. Since 2015 a lot of my free time was taken up developing the ARC-Edinburgh app with Edinburgh City Council. You can learn more about that project <a href="arcapp.co.uk">here</a>!
